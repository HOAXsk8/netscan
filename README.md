Python 3 random IP scanner

This program generates a random IP address and checks if it is in a global range. Once checked it scans the IP on a given port and returns the banner for that service and write the banner and IP to a text file for further analysis.

Use the BASH script to start 200 instances of the program at one time. The number can be changed as required. The use of the BASH script will be removed once multi-processing is integrated into the program.
